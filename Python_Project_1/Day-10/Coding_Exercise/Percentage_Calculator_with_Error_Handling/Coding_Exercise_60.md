### Percentage Calculator with Error Handling
Take a look at the code in the coding area. You should expand that code. Your task is to:

(1) calculate the percentage using the  ```value/total * 100``` formula

(2) print out the message "**That is 40.0%**" (or whatever the calculated percentage value is)
```
Enter total value: 50
Enter value: 20
That is 40.0%
```


(3) If the user doesn't enter a **number** but a string (e.g., hi) for the total value or the value, the program should print out the message shown in the screenshot below:
```
Enter total value: 20
Enter value: hi
You need to enter a number. Run the program again.
