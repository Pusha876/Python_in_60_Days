### Creating Multiple Text Files
In the coding area, we have defined a list of countries. Add some code that uses a for loop to generate a text file for each country (e.g., "Albania.txt", "Belgium.txt", and so on).

Each file should have its country name as content (e.g., Albania.txt has **Albania** as content).
