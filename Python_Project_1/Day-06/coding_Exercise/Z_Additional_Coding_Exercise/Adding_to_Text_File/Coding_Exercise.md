# Coding Exercise: Adding to Text File
Please code this exercise in your computer IDE, so you gain experience with working with text files in a local IDE. For this exercise, download the *members*.txt file attached to the resources. Then, create a program that:

1. prompts the user to enter a new member.

2. adds that member to members.txt at the end of the existing members. For example, the user here has entered the member *Solomon Right*.
```
Add a new member: Solomon Right
```


In the above example, Solomon Right will be added to *members*.txt updating the content of the file to:

*John Smith*

*Sen Lakmi*

*Sono Octonot*

*Solomon Right*
