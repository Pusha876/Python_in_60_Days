# Day 4: List-indexing and tuples

### Converting functions:
Converting between data types can be done with functions such as *int*, *float*, and *str*

### Accessing list items:
Can be done using the *list*[x] syntax where x is the index of the item you want to access. Keep in mind that the indexing system starts from zero (i.e., the first item of the list has an index of zero).

### List items:
Can be replaced using the syntax *list*[x] = *new_item* where x is the index of the item you want to replace and *new_item* is the value of the new item.

### number = number -1:
It is possible to update a variable you have defined earlier. All you have to do is redefine the variable using a new value or an expression that produces a new value (i.e., number -1).
