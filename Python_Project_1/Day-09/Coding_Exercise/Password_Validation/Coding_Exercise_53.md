### Password Validation
Write a program that:

(1) asks users to enter a password using an input() function,

(2) returns "***Great password there!***" if the password has **more** than 7 characters. For example:

---
Enter a new password: <span style="color: blue;">mycool_password3001</span>

Great password there!

---

(3) returns "***Your password is weak.***" if the password **has 7** or **fewer** characters. For example:

---
Enter a new password: <span style="color: blue;">1234</span>

Your password is weak.
