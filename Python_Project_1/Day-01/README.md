# Day 1: Variables, Functions, Arguments, Lists, Strings, and Print

### Variables:
Behave like boxes. You can store different data types in them such as strings and lists. Tip: Pick a name that make sense when creating variables.

### Arguments:
These are inputs used by functions. They can be any data type such as a sting, list, etc. They can also be a variable associated with a data type.

### Functions:
Are entities designed to perform a particular action. For example, a print function prints out text in the command line. An input function also prints out text in the command line but it also lets the user enter data.

### Lists:
Are types that represent as series of items. The items can be any other type such as string, numbers, and even lists.

### Strings:
Are types that represent text in your programs. They start and end with double or single quotes.
