# Day 3: match-case, Break statement, for-loops

### Match-case:
Is a code block that allows the programmer to match a given value against a series of other values. Match-case is useful when you expect the user to enter different predefined values such as certain commands, days of the week etc.

### Break statement:
Is an optional part of a while-loop. If the interpreter reaches the break statement, the while-loop will stop executing.

### For-loops:
Are blocks of code that iterate over objects that are made of other objects (e.g., lists). The loop will perform the same operation over all the items of the list.
