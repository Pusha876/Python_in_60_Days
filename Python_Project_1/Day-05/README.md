# Day 5: Enumeration and f-strings

### Enumerate:
Creates an object with the structure:
*[(index, item)*, *(index, item)*, *(index, item)]*
That kind of object makes it possible to iterate using two variables.

### f-strings:
They are specialized to replace the *(variable)* part with the value of the variable. It is also possible to have an expressions inside {} and not only variables.
