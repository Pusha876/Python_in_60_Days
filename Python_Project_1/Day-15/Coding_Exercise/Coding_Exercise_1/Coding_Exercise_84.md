### Coding Exercise 1
Your task is to create a program that generates a random whole number. Here is how the program should behave:
```
Enter the lower bound: 1
Enter the upper bound: 10
7
```

As you can see, the program first asks the user to enter a whole number. Then, once the user enters a number, the program asks the user again to enter another number.

Then, the program returns a random number that falls between the two whole numbers. Here is another example:
```
Enter the lower bound: 12
Enter the upper bound: 15
14
```
