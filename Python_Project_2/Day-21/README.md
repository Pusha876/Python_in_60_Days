## Prototyping with Figma

### What is Figma Prototype?
Figma prototype **allows you to create interactive flows that explore how a user may interact with your designs**. Prototypes are an excellent way to preview interactions and user flows and share and iterate on ideas.

### What is a prototype in general?
A prototype is a simulation or sample version of a final product, which UX teams use for testing before launch. With a prototype, the goal is to **test and validate ideas before sharing them with stakeholders and eventually pass the final designs to engineering teams for development**.

Prototypes are essential for solving and identifying user pain points with participants during usability testing. Testing prototypes with end-users enables UX teams to visualize and optimize the user experience during the design process.

### How do we use Figma Prototype in Design?
Figma is a powerful web-based design tool that **helps you create anything, websites, applications, logos, and much more**. You'll take your first steps into User Interface Design and User Experience Design by learning how to use Figma.

You can use it to do all kinds of graphic design work, from wireframing websites, designing mobile app interfaces, prototyping designs, crafting social media posts, and everything in between.

Learning graphic design in Figma will save you time and stress. When you work with this software, it makes the design process quick, fun, and very efficient. You can collaborate online with other people very quickly.
