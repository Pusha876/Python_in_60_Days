## Web Automation Options

1. http://the-internet.herokuapp.com: This site offers a variety of testing scenarios, including forms, authentication, and more. It's a great resource for practicing web automation.

2. https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/index.html: While this is primarily a documentation site for Selenium, it includes links to various demo applications that can be used for testing purposes.

3. https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp: W3Schools provides a simple HTML form that you can use to practice filling out and submitting forms.

I hope these options are helpful,
