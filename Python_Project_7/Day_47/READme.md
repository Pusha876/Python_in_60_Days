**Objects are Instantiated**
Humans are born. Objects are instantiated. A baby is an *instance* of a Human, an object is an *instance* of some Class.

The act of creating an *instance* of a Class is called **instantiation** (Ta-Da!)

**So declare, initialize, and instantiate come together like this**
```
MyClass myClassyReference = new MyClass();
```

In the above, it is wrong to say "... creating an instance of an object..."
---
Three distinct things are going on (above) using distinct terminology and that terminology is not interchangeable :

1. A reference variable is declared - ```MyClass myClassyReference```
1. An object is instantiated (...from/of a given class, implied) - ```new MyClass()```
1. The object is assigned to the variable. ```=```.
