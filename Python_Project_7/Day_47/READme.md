# Programming Skill of the Day

##  Code Refactoring
is the process of restructuring existing source code without changing its external behavior. The primary goal is to improve the design, structure, and implementation of the software, enhancing its non-functional attributes while preserving its functionality. Refactoring helps in improving code readability, reducing complexity, and making the source code more maintainable and extensible.

## Code Smells
Code smells are common programming characteristics that might indicate a problem in the code. Many times, the problem may be clear and visible. Other times, the problem may result in a future problem or a deeply rooted problem.
