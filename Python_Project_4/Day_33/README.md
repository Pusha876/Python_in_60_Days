* Any time there is more than one condition, you need an ```if``` statement.
* A ```try``` ```except``` block is the block of code (contains a set of statements) in which exceptions can occur; it's used to enclose the code that might throw an exception.
The reason to use ```try/except``` is when you have a code block to execute that will sometimes run correctly and sometimes not, depending on conditions you can't foresee at the time you're writing the code.

It addresses the unique needs of different frontends, ensuring optimized performance and tailored data responses. Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) is a helpful pattern that offers customization, flexibility and makes frontend development easier.
